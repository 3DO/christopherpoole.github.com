introduction: Most of the wiring is now complete, including braiding of umbilicals going to the motors.

Each motor needs a slightly longer cable, as well as the appropriate connector for connection to the RAMPS 1.4 driver.
Measure the required length of cable, slide on the correct amount of braid, and don't forget the heat shrink for each end.
Heat shrink the braid to the motor end, and slide the rest of it past the cable ends.
Next, make the solder connections and heat shrink for insulation:

Finally, slide the braid back over the newly make connections and heat shrink it at the connector end:

Braiding helps keep everything tidy, especially for the 4 wires going to each motor.
Overall I think it looks pretty good:
