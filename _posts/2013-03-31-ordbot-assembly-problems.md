[Previously](http://christopherpoole.github.com/ordbot-mechanical-assembly/) I gave a quick rundown on the mechanical assembly of an Ord Bot Hadron.
Since then a couple of small issues have presented themselves.
Firstly, the cap screws provided to mount the table motor, and the table and gantry belt tensioners are slightly too long.
Adding a small washer prevents the screw from bottoming out on the rail:

Table belt tensioner:

Gantry belt tensioner:

Secondly, the [QU-BD dual extruder](http://christopherpoole.github.com/QUBD-extruder-assembly/) generic mounting plate does not offer up well to the extruder carriage:

A single extruder can be mounted in the center of the carriage:

It looks like the first print job will be a proper mounting arrangement of the dual extruder.
