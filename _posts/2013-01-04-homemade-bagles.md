introduction: In Brisbane nice bagels can be hard to come by, so this is my first go at making them from scratch at home. On the whole it is pretty straight forwards; make dough, shape it, boil it, bake it.

## Ingredients

* 250g high protein flour (> 10%, I used 11.5%), usually sold as bread flour
* 1 cup, 160g warm water
* 1tsp, 5g dry yeast
* 3 tsp, 15g caster sugar
* 1/2 tsp table salt
* about 2 hours

Anything less than 20g I use a standard teaspoon to measure out with.
The rest, flour and water for example, I weigh.


## Method
Put all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl followed by the warm water; mechanically knead until combined, and the dough is no longer sticking to the sides of the mixing bowl.
Hand knead for a short while until it looks like this:

Let the dough ball rest in a covered bowl that has been placed in a warm area for around about 1 hour; it will at least double in size during this time.
Now is a good time to prepare for cooking; get a pan of water boiling on the stove, and pre-heat the oven for 200 C.
Beat the dough down, and weight it, I had a 420g dough ball which will yield four 105g bagels.
Divide the dough ball into four equal portions like so:

With well floured hands, pinch a hole through each ball using the thumb and forefinger (think A-Okay) and gently work into a ring:

Let the dough rings rest for a while, the oven should be almost hot enough for baking, and the water should now be boiling.
One at a time put a dough ring into the boiling water and poach for about 1 minute per side - the longer it is in the water, the more chewy your bagel will be.

Get the bagels onto some sort of baking sheet and sprinkle with seeds (I used sesame seeds).

Bake in the oven on the middle shelf at 200 C for 20 minutes or until they look like this:

## Results

This is the finished product, not sure what a good bagel crumb looks like, but this seems just fine to me.
