introduction: At long last I have purchased a 3D printer. After a considerable period of indecision, I finally settled on an Ord Bot Hadron kit; all Aluminum construction, no 3D printed parts, it seems ideal for modding. This is what's in the box.

Automation Technology Inc. offer a mechanical parts only Ord Bot Hadron kit.
Along with the kit I ordered a RepRap RAMPS 1.4 stepper motor diver board, and a stand along LCD controller.
Via FedEx, delivery time was 5 days from Illinois, USA to Brisbane, Australia.
The order arrived encased in more then enough bubble wrap:
