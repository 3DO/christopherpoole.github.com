introduction: I went out to buy a new moka pot a few weeks ago, it seemed as though it would be easy enough to use, put coffee in basket, boil. It turns out that is pretty much all there is to it, although with a little bit if technique.

## Equipment
All you need is a stove, a moka pot of some description and some ground coffee.
Most (all) typical moka pots are comprised of 5 key components; a water reservoir, coffee basket, and a collector with also contains a pressure plate and rubber seal.
