title: Using a Moka Pot - what works for me...

introduction: I went out to buy a new moka pot a few weeks ago, it seemed as though it would be easy enough to use, put coffee in basket, boil. It turns out that is pretty much all there is to it, although with a little bit if technique.

## Equipment
All you need is a stove, a moka pot of some description and some ground coffee.
Most (all) typical moka pots are comprised of 5 key components; a water reservoir, coffee basket, and a collector with also contains a pressure plate and rubber seal.

Before anything else, you need to get the water pre-heated.
Fill the water reservoir up to, or just below the pressure release value:

Put it onto the stove (medium heat) until it is boiling:

Whilst the pre-heating of the water is occuring, heap coffee into the coffee basket.
Do not tamp it down, however agitating/stirring with the spoon will help achieve an even fill:

Use a chopstick or similar to level off the coffee with a single motion.
The geometry of the pressure plate at the bottom of the collector is such that adequate compression of the coffee puck will be attained if and only if the coffee basket is filled and leveled off:

By now the water will be boiling.
Turn off the stove, hold the hot water reservoir with a dry cloth and screw the collector onto it until it makes a tight seal.
Turn the stove back on (medium heat) and wait for a stead flow of coffee to emerge:

When the brew is close to ready, coffee will start spitting out. It looks liked I stuffed this brew up, it started spitting a little early. Inspection of the puck post brewing showed that the coffee was not evenly distributed in the basket; a crack or river was present which allowed mostly water to freely flow though the puck without resistance from the coffee. A finer grind usually prevents this.
