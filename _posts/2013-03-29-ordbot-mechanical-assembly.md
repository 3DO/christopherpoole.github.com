introduction: The mechanical assembly of an Ord Bot Hadron is fairly straight forwards, we did it all from the technical drawings.

You can find all of the technical drawing for an Ord Bot Hadron [here](http://www.buildlog.net/wiki/doku.php?id=ord_bot:the_ord_bot), I found this sufficient for assembly.
The easiest bit to get going with is the head/carriage sub-assembly:

The carriage sub-assembly mounts onto the z-axis sub-assembly; nothing difficult so far:

The drawings for the table are slightly lacking, however it can be mostly figured out from the full assembly drawing:

Getting the z-axis frame square might be the most difficult part of the whole build

Correct positioning of the table with respect to the z-axis frame is quite important.
If the long end is too short, you will find that the whole frame is off balance:

The carriage sub-assemble floats, and is only held in place by gravity:
